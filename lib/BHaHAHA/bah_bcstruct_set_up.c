/**
 * EigenCoord_set_x0x1x2_inbounds__i0i1i2_inbounds_single_pt():
 * An "eigencoordinate" represents the simplest member of a given coordinate family,
 * often serving as the prototype for the entire family of coordinate systems.
 * For instance, all spherical-like coordinate systems share Spherical as their eigencoordinate.
 * Similarly, for cylindrical-like systems, Cylindrical is the eigencoordinate;
 * for Cartesian-like systems, Cartesian serves as the eigencoordinate;
 * and for SymTP-like systems (symmetric-TwoPunctures, a prolate-spheroidal coordinate system),
 * SymTP is the eigencoordinate.
 *
 * This function performs a dual mapping for a given grid point (i0, i1, i2) and its corresponding
 * coordinate (x0, x1, x2). The transformation is carried out as:
 * (x0, x1, x2) -> (Cartx, Carty, Cartz) -> (x0', x1', x2').
 *
 * Note that the resulting coordinates (x0', x1', x2') may not be identical to the original
 * (x0, x1, x2). For example, consider spherical coordinates (r, theta, phi) = (-0.1, pi/4, pi/4).
 * In this case, upon transformation, we obtain (r', theta', phi'), where r' is always positive,
 * as it is derived from the Euclidean distance, r = sqrt(Cartx^2 + Carty^2 + Cartz^2),
 * which is always non-negative. This makes the original (x0, x1, x2) an "inner boundary point."
 * On a cell-centered grid, such points will always map to a location within the interior of the grid.
 *
 * The process of filling such boundary points requires copying data, and when the data represents
 * vectors or tensors, it might involve multiplying by either +1 or -1 to ensure proper orientation
 * and consistency in the transformation.

 * At each coordinate point (x0,x1,x2) situated at grid index (i0,i1,i2):
 * *Step 1: Set up inner boundary structs bcstruct->inner_bc_array[].
 * *  Recall that at each inner boundary point we must set innerpt_bc_struct:
 * *    typedef struct {
 * *      int dstpt;  // dstpt is the 3D grid index IDX3(i0,i1,i2) of the inner boundary point (i0,i1,i2)
 * *      int srcpt;  // srcpt is the 3D grid index (a la IDX3) to which the inner boundary point maps
 * *      int8_t parity[28];  // parity[28] is a calculation of dot products for the 28 independent parity types
 * *    } innerpt_bc_struct;
 * *  At each ghostzone (i.e., each point within NGHOSTS points from grid boundary):
 * *    Call EigenCoord_set_x0x1x2_inbounds__i0i1i2_inbounds_single_pt().
 * *        This function converts the curvilinear coordinate (x0,x1,x2) to the corresponding
 * *        Cartesian coordinate (x,y,z), then finds the grid point
 * *        (i0_inbounds,i1_inbounds,i2_inbounds) in the grid interior or outer boundary
 * *        corresponding to this Cartesian coordinate (x,y,z).
 * *    If (i0,i1,i2) *is not* the same as (i0_inbounds,i1_inbounds,i2_inbounds),
 * *        then we are at an inner boundary point. We must set
 * *        bcstruct->inner_bc_array for this point, which requires we specify
 * *        both (i0_inbounds,i1_inbounds,i2_inbounds) [just found!] and parity
 * *        conditions for this gridpoint. The latter is found & specified within the
 * *        function set_parity_for_inner_boundary_single_pt().
 * *    If (i0,i1,i2) *is* the same as (i0_inbounds,i1_inbounds,i2_inbounds),
 * *        then we are at an outer boundary point. Take care of outer BCs in Step 2.
 * *Step 2: Set up outer boundary structs bcstruct->outer_bc_array[which_gz][face][idx2d]:
 * *  Recall that at each outer boundary point we must set outerpt_bc_struct:
 * *    typedef struct {
 * *      short i0,i1,i2;  // the outer boundary point grid index (i0,i1,i2), on the 3D grid
 * *      int8_t FACEX0,FACEX1,FACEX2;  // 1-byte integers that store
 * *      //                               FACEX0,FACEX1,FACEX2 = +1, 0, 0 if on the i0=i0min face,
 * *      //                               FACEX0,FACEX1,FACEX2 = -1, 0, 0 if on the i0=i0max face,
 * *      //                               FACEX0,FACEX1,FACEX2 =  0,+1, 0 if on the i1=i1min face,
 * *      //                               FACEX0,FACEX1,FACEX2 =  0,-1, 0 if on the i1=i1max face,
 * *      //                               FACEX0,FACEX1,FACEX2 =  0, 0,+1 if on the i2=i2min face, or
 * *      //                               FACEX0,FACEX1,FACEX2 =  0, 0,-1 if on the i2=i2max face,
 * *    } outerpt_bc_struct;
 * *  Outer boundary points are filled from the inside out, two faces at a time.
 * *    E.g., consider a Cartesian coordinate grid that has 14 points in each direction,
 * *    including the ghostzones, with NGHOSTS=2.
 * *    We first fill in the lower x0 face with (i0=1,i1={2,11},i2={2,11}). We fill these
 * *    points in first, since they will in general (at least in the case of extrapolation
 * *    outer BCs) depend on e.g., i0=2 and i0=3 points.
 * *    Simultaneously we can fill in the upper x0 face with (i0=12,i1={2,11},i2={2,11}),
 * *    since these points depend only on e.g., i0=11 and i0=10 (again assuming extrap. BCs).
 * *    Next we can fill in the lower x1 face: (i0={1,12},i1=2,i2={2,11}). Notice these
 * *    depend on i0 min and max faces being filled. The remaining pattern goes like this:
 * *    Upper x1 face: (i0={1,12},i1=12,i2={2,11})
 * *    Lower x2 face: (i0={1,12},i1={1,12},i2=1)
 * *    Upper x2 face: (i0={1,12},i1={1,12},i2=12)
 * *    Lower x0 face: (i0=0,i1={1,12},i2={1,12})
 * *    Upper x0 face: (i0=13,i1={1,12},i2={1,12})
 * *    Lower x1 face: (i0={0,13},i1=0,i2={2,11})
 * *    Upper x1 face: (i0={0,13},i1=13,i2={2,11})
 * *    Lower x2 face: (i0={0,13},i1={0,13},i2=0)
 * *    Upper x2 face: (i0={0,13},i1={0,13},i2=13)
 * *  Note that we allocate an outerpt_bc_struct at *all* boundary points,
 * *    regardless of whether the point is an outer or inner point. However
 * *    the struct is set only at outer boundary points. This is slightly
 * *    wasteful, but only in memory, not in CPU.
